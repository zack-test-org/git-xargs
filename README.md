# Gruntwork Prototypes

A repository to hold random prototypes built within Gruntwork.


## Convention

- New projects should create a new folder to segregate from the other projects.
- Every project should include a `README.md` with an overview of the project
  and instructions on how to use it.


## Graduated projects

- `terratest_failed_tests_log_parser`: Moved to [`terratest`](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/pull/179)
- `refarch_sanity_check`: Moved to [`usage-patterns`](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/usage-patterns/pull/238)
